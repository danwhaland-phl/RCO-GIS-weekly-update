# RCO-GIS-update
Run this script as needed to update the RCO DataBridge feature class. 

Once you have edited the RCO spatial and/or tabular data, go to P:\Zoning\RCO\RCO Data Entry\RCO_Updates.aprx. Open the Python window in the map and load in RCO_GIS_Update.py. Run the script (The email function might not work, but it isn’t really necessary, just nice to have). Once the script has finished running, export the new Zoning_RCO_rev layer to DataBridge using the planning DataBridge connection. If the email part of the script doesn’t work, email Jonathan Goins to let him know that the edits he requested were made and pushed to DataBridge.
